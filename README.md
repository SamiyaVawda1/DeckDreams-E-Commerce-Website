Overview and Purpose

DeckDreams is an e-commerce website that allows users to view and purchase skateboards. The website has a unique, fun and seamless design that matches the products being sold. All payments are simulated as this is not a production-ready project as yet, I made this website to practice and enhance my web development skills.
